### Description
Are you tired of picking the right JS library from a vast sea of libraries? And do you sometimes feel like frontend JavaScript development & code became unnecessarily complex?

HTMX might just be the right solution for you!

Because HTMX is an amazing JavaScript library that helps you avoid writing client-side JavaScript code!

It's a library that extends HTML by adding new attributes which you can use to add & control element behavior. Specifically, HTMX is a library that simplifies the process of sending AJAX requests and updating the DOM based on the response.

But you'll learn all about the core HTMX features as well as advanced HTMX concepts you need to know in detail in this course!

HTMX is a such an amazing library that allows you to write efficient client-side code that I simply had to create a course on it - even though I originally didn't plan to do that!

Therefore, in this course, I'll walk you through all core HTMX concepts step-by-step, without any prior HTMX knowledge assumed!

In detail, you'll learn:

- What HTMX is & how it works
- How to add HTMX to a website
- How to use HTMX for sending AJAX HTTP requests
- How to control request data
- How to control where the response will be rendered
- How to control which part of the response will be rendered
- How to handle responses with multiple content elements
- How to configure requests & responses
- How to build single-page-applications (SPAs) with HTMX

And much, much more!

And you'll learn all that by working on multiple demo projects which allow you to dive deeper and deeper into HTMX.

Therefore, by the end of the course, you'll be able to add HTMX to your next web projects and reap its benefits!
